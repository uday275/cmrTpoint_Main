                <p>
                    Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few
                    implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers write once,
                    and run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java
                    without the need for recompilation. Java was first released in 1995 and is widely used for
                    developing applications for desktop, web, and mobile devices. Java is known for its simplicity,
                    robustness, and security features, making it a popular choice for enterprise-level applications.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align:justify">
                    <strong>JAVA</strong>
                    was developed by James Gosling at
                    <strong>Sun Microsystems</strong>
                    <u>
                    </u>Inc in the year
                    <strong>1995</strong>
                    &nbsp;and later acquired by Oracle Corporation. It is a simple programming language. Java makes
                    writing, compiling, and debugging programming easy.&nbsp;It helps to create reusable code and
                    modular programs.

                    language and is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. A general-purpose
                    programming language made for developers to <i>write once run anywhere</i> that is compiled Java
                    code can run on all platforms that support Java. Java applications are compiled to byte code that
                    can run on any Java Virtual Machine. The syntax of Java is similar to c/c++.
                </p>
                <c1 class="c1">History:</c1>


                <p>
                    Java’s history is very interesting. It is a programming language created in 1991. James
                    Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton, a team of Sun engineers known as the Green team
                    initiated the Java language in 1991. Sun Microsystems released its first public implementation in
                    1996 as Java 1.0. It provides no-cost -run-times on popular platforms. Java1.0 compiler was
                    re-written in Java by Arthur Van Hoff to strictly comply with its specifications. With the arrival
                    of Java 2, new versions had multiple configurations built for different types of platforms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 1997, Sun Microsystems approached the ISO standards body and later formalized Java, but it soon
                    withdrew from the process. At one time, Sun made most of its Java implementations available without
                    charge, despite their proprietary software status. Sun generated revenue from Java through the
                    selling of licenses for specialized products such as the Java Enterprise System.
                </p>
                <p>

                    On November 13, 2006, Sun released much of its Java virtual machine as free, open-source software.
                    On May 8, 2007, Sun finished the process, making all of its JVM’s core code available under
                    open-source distribution terms.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The principles for creating java were simple, robust, secured, high-performance, portable,
                    multi-threaded, interpreted, dynamic, etc. In 1995 Java was developed by James Gosling, who is known
                    as the Father of Java. Currently, Java is used in mobile devices, internet programming, games,
                    e-business, etc.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Implementation of a Java application program involves a following step. They include:
                    <br>
                    "1. Creating the program"
                    <br>
                    "2. Compiling the program"
                    <br>
                    "3. Running the program"
                </p>
                <p>
                    Remember that, before we begin creating the program, the Java Development Kit (JDK) must be properly
                    installed on our system and also path will be set.
                    <br>• Creating Program
                    <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;We can create a program using Text Editor (Notepad) or IDE (NetBeans)
                    <br>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; class Test
                    <br>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; {
                    <br>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;public static void
                    main(String []args)
                    <br>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;{
                    <br>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
                    System.out.println(“My First Java Program.”);
                    <br>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;}
                    <br>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; };
                </p>
                <p>
                    File -&gt; Save -&gt; d:\Test.java
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;"

                </p>
                <p>
                    • Compiling the program
                    <br>
                    &nbsp; To compile the program, we must run the Java compiler (javac), with the name of the source
                    file on “command prompt” like as follows

                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp; If everything is OK, the “javac” compiler creates a file called “Test.class” containing byte
                    code of the program.

                </p>
                <p>
                    • Running the program
                    <br>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp;We need to use the Java Interpreter to run a program.
                </p>
                <c1 class="c1">Java programming language is named JAVA. Why?</c1>

                <p>
                    After the name OAK, the team decided to give it a new name to it and the suggested words were Silk,
                    Jolt, revolutionary, DNA, dynamic, etc. These all names were easy to spell and fun to say, but they
                    all wanted the name to reflect the essence of technology. In accordance with James Gosling, Java the
                    among the top names along with Silk, and since java was a unique name so most of them preferred it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Java is the name of an island in Indonesia where the first coffee(named java coffee) was produced.
                    And this name was chosen by James Gosling while having coffee near his office. Note that Java is
                    just a name, not an acronym.
                </p>

                <c1 class="c1">Java Terminology</c1>

                <p>

                    Before learning Java, one must be familiar with these common terms of Java.
                </p>
                <p>

                    <Strong>1. Java Virtual Machine(JVM):</Strong> This is generally referred to as JVM. There are three
                    execution phases
                    of a program. They are written, compile and run the program.
                </p>

                <li style="text-align:justify">Writing a program is done by a java programmer like you and me.</li>
                <li style="text-align:justify">The compilation is done by the <strong>JAVAC</strong> compiler which is a
                    primary Java compiler included in the Java development kit (JDK). It takes the Java program as input
                    and generates bytecode as output.</li>

                <li style="text-align:justify">In the Running<strong> </strong>phase of a program,<strong> JVM</strong>
                    executes the bytecode generated by the compiler.</li>

                <p style="text-align:justify">Now, we understood that the function of Java Virtual Machine is to execute
                    the bytecode produced by the compiler. Every Operating System has a different JVM but the output
                    they produce after the execution of bytecode is the same across all the operating systems. This is
                    why Java is known as a<strong> platform-independent language.</strong></p>

                <p style="text-align:justify"><strong>2. Bytecode in </strong>the <strong>Development Process:
                        &nbsp;</strong>As discussed, the Javac compiler of JDK compiles the java source code into
                    bytecode so that it can be executed by JVM. It is saved as <strong>.class</strong> file by the
                    compiler. To view the bytecode, a disassembler like javap can be used.
                </p>
                <p style="text-align:justify"><strong>3. Java Development Kit(JDK): </strong>While we were using the
                    term JDK when we learn about bytecode and JVM. So, as the name suggests, it is a complete Java
                    development kit that includes everything including compiler, Java Runtime Environment (JRE), java
                    debuggers, java docs, etc. For the program to execute in java, we need to install JDK on our
                    computer in order to create, compile and run the java program.</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify"><strong>4. Java Runtime Environment (JRE): </strong>JDK includes JRE. JRE
                    installation on our computers allows the java program to run, however, we cannot compile it. JRE
                    includes a browser, JVM, applet support, and plugins. For running the java program, a computer needs
                    JRE.</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify"><strong>5. Garbage Collector: </strong>In Java, programmers can’t delete
                    the objects. To delete or recollect that memory JVM has a program called Garbage Collector.
                    Garbage Collectors can recollect the objects that are not referenced. So Java makes the life of a
                    programmer easy by handling memory management. However, programmers should be careful about their
                    code whether they are using objects that have been used for a long time. Because Garbage cannot
                    recover the memory of objects being referenced.</p>
                <p style="text-align:justify"><strong>6. ClassPath: </strong>The classpath is the file path
                    where the java runtime and Java compiler look for <strong>.class</strong> files to load. By default,
                    JDK provides many libraries. If you want to include external libraries they should be added to the
                    classpath.</p>
                <c1 class="c1">Applications</c1>
                <p>According to Sun, 3 billion devices run Java. There are many devices where Java is currently used.
                    Some of them are as follows:</p>
